  ## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> ReactJs, TailwindCSS, Firebase & Firestore
  
  I made this project to strengthen my CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) knowledge. Todolist app is not one of the most original ideas but it gives you valuable practice opportunities. I love using ReactJs and Firebase together, it gives you so much power yet it's easy to implement to your project. 
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  
  Creating, updating or reading can be done in server-side but deleting should be done in client-side. So I had to find the right way to implement this to my project. Hopefully, I've come accross with a good article about this situation. 
  
  Secondly, as I wanted to be sure that users must exist in order to use my app, I created a protected route but didn't provide a fallback route which ended up bouncing back to sign in page even though the user signed up and can use the app. So it created a problem that I had to fix. Thankfully, it wasn't as complex as it sounded so I ended up by creating a fallback route which is not protected but it prevents non-existing users further interactions.
  
  Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience.
